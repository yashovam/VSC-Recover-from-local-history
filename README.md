# VSC-Recover-from-local-history

Hello, Ever accidentaly hit 'discard all' on git and deleted all your files?
Or perhaps just need to recover files from vscodes local history, but dont feel like doing it one file at a time.


## How to use
IF undoing git clean and you have the output log on hand:

the script will prompt you with a filebrowse to check for a list, this is where you want to select the Git output, which can be simply copied to a txt file and selected

ELSE:


And this will produce a flow chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
